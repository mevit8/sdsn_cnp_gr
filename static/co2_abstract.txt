This study employs the latest version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and its accompanying database to evaluate the economic and environmental implications of a uniform carbon tax in Europe. Specifically, the analysis simulates the introduction of a homogeneous carbon tax of €50 per ton of carbon across European countries. The model framework enables a detailed assessment of the macroeconomic and sectoral adjustments triggered by such a policy, providing insights into its potential effectiveness and trade-offs. The results highlight the tax’s impact on gross domestic product (GDP), sectoral production patterns, and carbon emissions. These outcomes are presented graphically to illustrate the magnitude and distribution of effects across the European region, providing a comprehensive perspective on the impact of carbon taxation on both economic performance and emission reduction goals.
