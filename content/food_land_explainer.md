## Food–Land System Results

**GHG Emissions**  
The NCNC scenario cuts agricultural GHG emissions by 50% (3 MtCO₂e) by 2050 compared to BAU, mainly through reduced livestock emissions and increased land-based carbon withdrawals.

**Production**  
Higher agricultural productivity in NCNC improves climate mitigation and competitiveness, with a clear divergence from BAU after 2035, especially in crop-related emissions.

**Costs**  
Total agricultural costs drop from €828M (2025) to <€630M (2050) in NCNC, mainly due to a 27.5% reduction in pesticide expenses and a 14.8% decline in fertilizer costs.

**Land Use**  
Pastureland shrinks by 78% from 2020 to 2050 in NCNC due to diet shifts and productivity gains, leading to a surge in land categorized as “Other” in the FABLE Calculator.
