## Biofuel production potential

The results indicate that there is a significant potential to produce biofuels domestically, ranging from 208-435ktoe in 2022 to 268-519ktoe in 2050.

This production can fully cover the biofuel demand from uses such as agriculture, energy production and transformation processes, and the excess amount can be used for exports.

This is an important finding for Greece, which currently imports biofuels \& has no plan so far to utilize them for other sectors such as shipping (despite the recommendations of the recent IMO's FuelEU Maritime regulation).
