## The SDSN pathway: ## A Decision Support approach under Uncertainty

We provide a Decision Framework to achieve the legally binding National Commitments (NCNC) with a btter way: Less emissions, faster, cheaper, and  with less efforts (implementation measures).

We used these criteria (GHG emissions, Cost of decarbonization measures, Energy supply dependency, Energy Consumption) in a Fuzzy AHP process, where the decision-makers will compare them. Accounting for "opinion uncertainty", we use the Fuzzy version of AHP.

In an indicative run, we (as modellers) weighted these four criteria, and the results look like this:

We then simulated all the 30 decarbonization measures included in the Greek National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP). A Fuzzy TOPSIS was then applied to evaluate their performance to each criterion, accounting thus for data, modelling and implementation time uncertainties.

This ranking of the ‘best – performing’ alternatives resulted in a sub-set of 18 decarbonization measures (out of 30), so that their priority application can achieve the same decarbonization level with the NECP.

The results indicate that this SDSN decarbozation pathway achieves 

* Lower emissions \& faster
* Lower costs
* Lower dependency on imports \[compared to the original NECP]

**The SDSN Decision pathway is transferable and easily adaptable to any case study.**
