The simulation considers two scenarios: 

the do-nothing scenario (business-as-usual - BAU) which assumes that the current trends will continue applying until 2050; 

the NCNC (National Climate Neutrality Commitments) scenario which assumes that the main sector climate-neutrality policies are jointly implemented. [e.g. cleaner fuels & increased energy efficiency]

The main policy instrument was simulated for each sector. 

Other policies that are not considered in this study concern mostly economic measures, which were not simulated because this example does not include economic models.
Ecosystems Economic Valuation & Beyond-GDP models, and General Computable Equilibrium (GCE) models are included in our future research plans.
