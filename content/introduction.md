Climate Neutrality Pathways for Greece Scenario Selector Dashboard is based on <a href="https://www.unsdsn.org/our-work/sdsn-global-climate-hub">SDSN Global Climate Hub</a> Climate Neutrality Pathways for Greece: <a href="https://unsdsn.globalclimatehub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/REPORT_GCHmodels_SDSNscenario_Greece__2.pdf">Integrated Assessment and Decision Support Tool Report</a>: June 2025

## The Simulation considers two scenarios: 

**Do-nothing scenario (business-as-usual - BAU)** which assumes that the current trends will continue applying until 2050; 

**NCNC (National Climate Neutrality Commitments) scenario** which assumes that the main sector climate-neutrality policies are jointly implemented. [e.g. cleaner fuels & increased energy efficiency]

*The main policy instrument was simulated for each sector.*

*Other policies that are not considered in this study concern mostly economic measures, which were not simulated because this example does not include economic models.
Ecosystems Economic Valuation & Beyond-GDP models, and General Computable Equilibrium (GCE) models are included in our future research plans.*

## Model Integration

- FABLE Calculator (Mosnier et al., 2020) for the potential evolution of food and land-use systems; 

- The Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) (Heaps, 2022) for the simulation of the energy consumption and the associated GHG emissions of multiple pollutants; 

- MaritimeGCH for the simulation of the shipping sector’s climate-neutrality (Alamanos, Koundouri, et al., 2024)

- WaterRequirements accounting tool (Alamanos & Koundouri, 2024) for the estimation of the water requirements of the studied sectors

- LandReqCalcGCH model to estimate the land requirements for any potentially additional renewable energy production units. 

- All the models run under a common simulation period, 2020 to 2050, at an annual time-step.
