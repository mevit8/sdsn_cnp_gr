## Shipping Sector

** The simulated NCNC involves **:a) combination of emission-reduction technologies (Engine power optimization; Route Optimizer technology, Port-call technology, Energy-efficient propulsion system; Hull cleaning and maintenance; On board carbon capture)
b) moderate fuel-transition projection, assuming that oil fuels will gradually phase out (Oil and Refined Petroleum products), being replaced by the transition fuels (LNG and LPG), while by 2050 they will be replaced by clean fuels such as MeOH, NH3 and H2.

** Fleet Growth **: Steady increase in shipping demand drives fleet expansion, surpassing 1,400 vessels by 2050, with notable growth in container and passenger ships. 
Investment Trends: Costs remain stable until 2045 (€1-1.5B) but rise sharply near 2050 (€2B) due to new vessel demand. 
Fuel Transition: Shift from oil to LNG & LPG (mid-term) and NH3, MeOH & H2 (long-term), reducing emissions but raising fuel costs. 
Emissions & ETS Impact: Emissions exceed the cap by 6MT in 2050; ETS penalties begin in the late 2030s, increasing costs for shipowners. 
Decarbonization Challenges: Full decarbonization by 2050 is unlikely without subsidies, technology advancements, and stronger commitments. 
Policy & Infrastructure Needs: Coordinated regulatory support, fuel-saving technologies, and alternative fuel bunkering infrastructure are essential for a smooth green transition.
