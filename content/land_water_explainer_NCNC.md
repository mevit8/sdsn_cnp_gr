## Land \& Water Requirements

The implementation of the NCNC, requires in total 35051MW of solar energy, and 24780MW of wind power in 2050. This corresponds to an additional capacity of 28051MW and 16280MW respectively, compared to the current (2025) solar and wind power. Moreover, the NCNC projects that 52.46% of the wind power will be onshore, while the rest should be offshore. So, this results in 8541MW.

So, for **solar panels that would range from 670km2 (min) to 846km2 (average) and to 1022km2 (max)**. 

The **onshore wind farms would require from 19km2 (min) to 25km2 (average) and to 35km2 (max).** 

Regarding the solar panels, the cost would range (min-average-max) **from 1005million€ to 1269million€ and to 1533million€**. The respective costs for the wind farms would range **from 18.8 million€ to 25.3million€ and to 35million€**.

The water requirements results indicate:

**High Uncertainty in Water Sector:** Influenced by socio-economic, infrastructure, and hydro-climatological factors; no sector-specific demand management in Greek RBMPs.
**Urban Water Use:** Represents 7–8% of total consumption; decreases from 725.19hm³ (2020) to 630.31hm³ (2050) due to population decline; network loss reduction could lower it further to 578hm³.
**Agricultural Water Use:** Dominates at 88–89%; increases slightly after 2025, reaching 8041.12hm³ by 2050; assumes stable livestock and irrigation areas.
**Industrial Water Use:** Smallest share (3–4%); remains stable with a slight increase from 328hm³ (2020) to 331.61hm³ (2050); no specific measures for industry in NCNC scenario.
**Seasonal Water Demand:** Peaks during summer (May–October) due to irrigation and tourism; July demand (1866.6hm³) is over 8× higher than December (134.55hm³), stressing the need for storage and distribution.
