## Shipping Sector

The *MaritimeGCH* model is an Investment Decision Support Tool (IDST), based on dynamic linear programming optimization (Alamanos \& Koundouri, 2024; Alamanos, 2025).

While the LEAP model is focused on port-related fuel flows and policy, the MaritimeGCH model is aimed at ship owners, providing insights into fleet investment and operational decisions for ships travelling anywhere, under the Greek flag.
