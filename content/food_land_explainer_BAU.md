## Foodâ€“Land System

**The FABLE (Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land Use, and Energy) Calculator** uses primarily land use and crop data, agronomic, livestock, climate and socio-economic data from the FAOSTAT and the CORINE databases, to calculate production outputs, factors, costs and emissions, when considering land restrictions and demand requirements.

The production-based GHG emissions refer to direct emissions from production activities and processes, agronomic practices, and non-energy uses (e.g. livestock emissions.
