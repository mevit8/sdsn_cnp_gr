## Land & Water Requirements

The water requirements of all sectors studied in LEAP, are calculated by the WaterReqGCH accounting tool (Alamanos & Koundouri, 2024).
The estimation of water requirements followed the same approach with the energy demand, assuming an Activity Level (AL), typical water consumption rates (CR), and losses coefficients (LC), per sector and use.

** High Uncertainty in Water Sector **: Influenced by socio-economic, infrastructure, and hydro-climatological factors; no sector-specific demand management in Greek RBMPs.
Urban Water Use: Represents 7–8% of total consumption; decreases from 725.19hm³ (2020) to 630.31hm³ (2050) due to population decline; network loss reduction could lower it further to 578hm³.
** Agricultural Water Use ** : Dominates at 88–89%; increases slightly after 2025, reaching 8041.12hm³ by 2050; assumes stable livestock and irrigation areas.
** Industrial Water Use **: Smallest share (3–4%); remains stable with a slight increase from 328hm³ (2020) to 331.61hm³ (2050); no specific measures for industry in NCNC scenario.
Seasonal Water Demand: Peaks during summer (May–October) due to irrigation and tourism; July demand (1866.6hm³) is over 8× higher than December (134.55hm³), stressing the need for storage and distribution.
