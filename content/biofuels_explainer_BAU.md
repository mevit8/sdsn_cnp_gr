## Biofuel production potential

The BiofuelGCH Calculator uses FABLE Calculator’s outputs (crop \& livestock products’ residues) that are eligible \& available for biofuels production (e.g. bioethanol \& biodiesel)

Then, with typical production values from the literature it estimates the potential for bioethanol and biodiesel production, comparing them with the existing demands.
