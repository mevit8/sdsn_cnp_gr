## Cross-sectoral Energy-Emissions Results

**Energy Consumption & Emissions**: The NCNC scenario reduces total energy demand by 23%, with industry (-58%) and transport (-34%) seeing the largest drops. Residential energy use declines due to population shrinkage & improved efficiencies, while services (+28%) and agriculture (+15%) increase.

**Energy Supply Shift**: Oil refining drops 3x, while electricity production rises by 6.5 Mtoe in 2050. Hydrogen and synthetic fuels contribute 1.1 Mtoe and 571 ktoe, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting GHG emissions from 26MtCO₂eq (2022) to 5.2MtCO₂eq (2050).

**Renewable Expansion**: NCNC projections lead to 77% less natural gas use, complete lignite phase-out, and a 540% increase in wind/solar by 2050. Hydropower grows 120%, accelerating the clean energy transition.

**GHG Emissions (100-Year GWP) Reduction**: NCNC achieves a 91.7% cut in emissions by 2050, reaching near total decarbonization, while BAU trends upward.
