## Land \& Water Requirements

The LandReqCalcGCH model receives inputs from LEAP regarding the future energy mix, and estimates the land requirements for additional solar panels and onshore wind farms installation.

The water requirements of all sectors studied in LEAP, are calculated by the WaterReqGCH accounting tool (Alamanos \& Koundouri, 2024).

The estimation of water requirements followed the same approach with the energy demand, assuming an Activity Level (AL), typical water consumption rates (CR), and losses coefficients (LC), per sector and use.
