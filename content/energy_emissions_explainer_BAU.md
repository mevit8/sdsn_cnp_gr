## Cross-sectoral Energy-Emissions

**The LEAP model** considers the main sectors of the economy, and estimates their energy requirements by considering an Activity Level (AL) and their energy intensity (EI, energy use per unit of activity).

The model has also a detailed representation of all primary feedstock fuels, secondary fuels \& their transformation processes to feed the demand.

The emissions are estimated based on the emission coefficients of the IPCCâ€™s Fifth Assessment Report per sector, per use and per fuel type for the demand side, and per process for the supply side.
